# `VASP_HTC_framework`ï¼š a Python Framework for First-Principles Hight-throughput Calculations Using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Packages (VASP)

### `Master` Branch: stable and work well on python2.7
### `upgrading_to_python_3` Branch: The branch we are working on to upgrade to python3

### Package requirements: pymatgen

### Please refer to [Manual](https://github.com/bitsoal/VASP_HTC_framework/blob/upgrade_to_python_3/Manual.md) for the application and execution of this package.

  
## A series of things to be added

2. add new tags `INCAR_cmd`, `KPOINTS_cmd`, `POTCAR_cmd`, `POSCAR_cmd`, allowing users to deal with them, respectively. These tags can
	*avoid heavily using user_defined_cmd & final_user_defined_cmd.
	*aleviate the reliance on pymatgen. Users can call pymatgen to create vasp input files using these new tags. More user freedom
		**provide a bunch of template scripts calling pymatgen for vasp input file creation.
		
3. upgrade to python3

4. add a new calculation status file named as `__done_cleaned__`. The program is going to the calculation folder labelled by `__done__` and delete the irrelevant files specified by a new tag del_irrelevant_output_files
	
	
6. re-think about sub folder calculations to automize the convergence testing of ENCUT, SIGMA, KPOINTS as well as lattice optimizatoin one by one. Provide corresponding scripts.
	
7. set DIPOL

8. read e_fermi and set EMIN & EMAX for DOS calculations.
